# vscode-docker-node-sample

Sample app using ES6 Node.js and TypeScript with Docker containers and Debug support using VSCode.

Inspired by many and a work in progress.

Currently there is a dependency on an external mongodb docker image.
You can change your mongodb target in /src/app/dataAccess/DataAccess.ts

I wanted to see how well my node-express image plays with other @docker containers. I promise I will try and make it a little more intuituve in time.
